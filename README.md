# Company-Sales-Analysis

Data Analysis methodologies can be applied to compare Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot to determine the best library for representing a chart based on ease of implementation and other factors.


## Objective

Determine which library is suitable to handle the following scenarios:

### Exercise 1:

Read Total profit of all months and show it using a line plot
Total profit data provided for each month. Generated line plot must include the following properties: 

#### – X label name = Month Number
#### – Y label name = Total profit

### Exercise 2: 
Get total profit of all months and show line plot with the following Style properties
Generated line plot must include following Style properties: 
#### – Line Style dotted 
#### – Line-color should be red
Show legend at the lower right location.
#### – X label name = Month Number
#### – Y label name = Sold units number
Add a circle marker.
Line marker color as read
Line width should be 3

### Exercise 3: 
Read all product sales data and show it using a multiline plot
Display the number of units sold per month for each product using multiline plots. (i.e., Separate Plotline for each product).

### Exercise 4: 
Read toothpaste sales data of each month and show it using a scatter plot
Also, add a grid in the plot. gridline style should “–“.

### Exercise 5: 
Read face cream and facewash product sales data and show it using the bar chart

### Exercise 6: 
Read sales data of bathing soap of all months and show it using a bar chart. Save this plot to your hard disk

### Exercise 7: 
Read the total profit of each month and show it using the histogram to see the most common profit ranges

### Exercise 8: 
Calculate total sale data for last year for each product and show it using a Pie chart

### Exercise 9: 
Read Bathing soap facewash of all months and display it using the Subplot

### Exercise 10: 
Read all product sales data and show it using the stack plot
